Dwight David Howard II (born December 8, 1985) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Taoyuan Leopards of the T1 League. He began his career in the National Basketball Association (NBA), where he was an NBA champion, eight-time All-Star, eight-time All-NBA Team honoree, five-time All-Defensive Team member, and three-time Defensive Player of the Year. Howard was born in Atlanta, to Dwight Sr. and Sheryl Howard, a family with strong athletic connections. His father is a Georgia State Trooper and is the athletic director at Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, a private academy with one of the country's best high school basketball programs; his mother played on the inaugural women's basketball team at Morris Brown College.[1] Howard's mother had seven miscarriages before he was born.[2] A devout Christian since his youth, Howard became serious about basketball around the age of nine.[3][4] Despite his large frame, Howard was quick and versatile enough to play the guard position.[4] He attended Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy and played mostly as power forward, averaging 16.6 points, 13.4 rebounds and 6.3 blocks per game in 129 appearances.[1][4] As a senior, Howard led his team to a 31â€“2 record and the 2004 state title,[4][5] while averaging 25 points, 18 rebounds, 8.1 blocks and 3.5 assists per game.[4] The same year, he was widely recognized as the best American high school basketball player, and received the Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award, the Morgan Wootten High School Player of the Year Award, Gatorade National Player of the Year and the McDonald's National High School Player of the Year honor.[6] He was also co-MVP (with J. R. Smith) of the McDonald's All-American Game that year.[6] On January 31, 2012, Howard was honored as one of the 35 greatest McDonald's All-Americans.[7]
